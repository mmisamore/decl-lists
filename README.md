# Description

This module contains a pure declarative approach to processing with (both lazy and traditional)
lists in Prolog. Logical correctness and declarative semantics are prioritized over performance.
Choice points are minimized wherever possible and all possible computable modes are supported for
every provided predicate.

This module is intended for use with SWI Prolog; please see LICENSE for terms of use. 

This module is extensively tested to help ensure correct behavior, but bugs may remain. Fixes are
appreciated.
